# 2D Transformations
* Created by Ryo Kurashina (rk2014@ic.ac.uk) during Summer 2017
* Created for Dimitri Vvedensky for his first year Physics Linear Algebra course.

## Level of Completion
The code is fully commented and visualization is completed to an acceptable standard.

### Possible Improvements:
* Could possibly add an undo button to undo transformations.
* Perhaps link the area change of the box when transformed to the determinant.
