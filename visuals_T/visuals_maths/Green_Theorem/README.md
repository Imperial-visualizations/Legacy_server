# Green's Theorem
* Created by Ryo Kurashina (rk2014@ic.ac.uk) during Summer 2017.
* Created for Marina Garland for her first year Physics VC course.

## Level of Completion
Visualization is fully completed and commented. It was designed more as an aide to Marina's notes for her course. Any changes to the 
mathematical content should be checked by Marina or the lecturer of the VC course.

### Possible improvements
Some of the animations could be a little smoother, however this is probably an issue with the speed of my quiver function.
