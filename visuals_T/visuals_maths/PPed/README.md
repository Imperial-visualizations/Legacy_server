# Parallelepipeds
* Created by Ryo Kurashina during Summer 2017.
* Created for Dimitri Vvedensky for his first year Physics Linear Algebra course.

## Level of Completion
Code is fully commented.
### Possible Improvements
* The mesh3D is a nice feature for plotting the parallelepiped but it would be better for lines to be 
plotted over as well to make the outline of the shape more visible.
* Perhaps arrow colours could be chosen better.
* I would like to add brackets around the triple product equation to reinforce that the cross product must be done first.
